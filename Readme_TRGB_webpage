== Organize the TRGB Galaxy Webpages ==

## Path ##

TRGB related files are located at /data2/LV on huchra. Each galaxy has its own directory, whose name should be the same as it shown on the TRGB distance information page. Files from different HST programs are under separate sub-directories, indicated by the HST program number. Take NGC300 for example. It is observed by 3 HST programs, therefore there are 3 sub-directories under /data2/LV/NGC300 : 
/data2/LV/NGC300/8584 
/data2/LV/NGC300/9162 
/data2/LV/NGC300/10915 

## File Names ##

The galaxy webpage is controlled by the php program: 
/home/huchra/distance/public_html/get_cmd.php. 

All related files should be put under the corresponding directory:
/data2/LV/"Galaxy_Name"/"HSTprogram#" ,
and should follow the naming system that the program can identify them and show them with correct picture title.

--Name List--

 CMD -- *gif.WEB
 clipped CMD -- *cmdclip.gif.WEB
 xy file -- *xy.jpg.WEB
 dolphot photometry -- *phot.WEB
 footprint image -- *jpg.WEB
 psuedo color image (4000x4000 pixel) -- *color.jpg.WEB
 small psuedo color image (600x600 pixel) -- *color600.jpg.WEB
 small Postage Stamp image of the target galaxy -- *poststamp.jpg.WEB

Notes:
 1) The asterisk can be any string, not necessarily the galaxy name. The program does not check.
 2) The *phot.WEB file must exist to show everything correctly.
 3) Clicking on the CMD will link to the dolphot photometry text file (*phot.WEB).
