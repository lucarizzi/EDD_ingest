catalogs.pl updated to allow for categories in catalogs definition.
also, all the UPDATE commands have been tranferred to the new syntax, with > ' < 
to start and end lines, and > " < to indicate column names.

HOW TO UPDATE DATABASE:
cd dim/perl

make drop
make create_noxcorr

if there are errors:
make drop

 *** THIS IS OPTIONAL BUT HELPS
psql hl        (this enter the postgresql command line interface)
-> delete from kcolumns;
-> delete from ktables;
\q             (this exits the postgresql command line interface)
***********************************

make create_noxcorr >& error
wait...
look into error and see what is going on

*** IF THE ERROR IS: table xxx already exists. **********************
It means that make drop is unable to delete the corresponding table.
Fix: 
psql hl
drop table XXX;
\q
Might be useful to check if other tables are stuck in there.
the command: 
\z 
gives you the list of table.
manually delete every table that starts with the letter "k"
*********************************************************************


if no errors:
make test_mysql
(takes about 5 minutes)

cd dim/mysql

20091211   here is the temporary fix for the missing galaxies:

  cp ../update_PGC_numbers.sh .
  sh update_PGC_numbers.sh
  *** check the file PGC.list.new to verify it looks ok: it is a slightly longer version of the file pgc ***
  cp PGC.list.new pgc

mysql -u distance -p < create.sql
when asked for password: 100Mpc

On Huchra:

Top 3 lines of create.sql should make reference to EDDsDB rather than DISTANCEdim

mysql -u distance -p EDDsDB < create.sql
when asked for password: CosmicFlu2

**********************************************************************

ENABLING ACCESS IN EDD (instructions from Shaya 2012/05/11)

Within the directory /home/huchra/distance/dim

*** 2015/01/08: Ed made simplified copy of createEDDDB.sql -> cedd.sql ***

Catalog kwhatever NOT shown in public EDD, add line

and dbtable != 'kwhatever'


To enable an entire catalog:
edit createEDDDB.sql by adding a line

CREATE VIEW kxxxx AS SELECT * FROM EDDsDB.kxxxx

To enable rows within a catalog:

CREATE VIEW kxxxx AS SELECT * FROM EDDsDB kxxxx WHERE P=1

Run with:

XXX mysql -u distance -p < createEDDDB.sql XXX
2015, January becomes

mysql -u distance -p < cedd.sql

CosmicFlu2

This is the fast version (no xcorr with LEDA).
If all goes well, go back and use make create instead of make create_noxcorr
this takes about 2 hours

..........

Just in case it gets lost, here is update_PGC_numbers.sh

#!/bin/sh
\rm PGC_NOTSORTED
touch PGC_NOTSORTED
cat create.sql | grep INFILE | cut -d \" -f 2 | grep -v PGC > database_list

for f in `cat database_list`; do
         cut -d "|" -f 1 $f >> PGC_NOTSORTED
done

cat PGC_NOTSORTED | sed s/pgc//g | sort -nk1 | sed s/" "//g | sed '/^0/d' | grep -v k| sort -n | uniq | awk 'NF>0 {print $0}' | grep -v No> PGC.list.new

echo YOU HAVE PGC.list.new!!!!
echo Check that it is correct and replace PGC.list
echo Then run mysql -u distance -p < create.sql

Cheers,
  Luca
